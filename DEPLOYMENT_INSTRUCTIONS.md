# 🚀 Railway Deployment Instructions - PostgreSQL Solution

## ✅ **VERIFIED: This is Railway's Official Recommended Approach**

Railway doesn't support shared volumes between services. The official solution is to use PostgreSQL database with Reference Variables, which is exactly what we've implemented.

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Deployment Guide**

### **Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Service to Railway**

1. Open your Railway project dashboard
2. Click the **"+ New"** button
3. Select **"Database"** → **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Wait ~30 seconds for PostgreSQL to deploy
5. ✅ You should see a new PostgreSQL service in your project

---

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**

You need to add `DATABASE_URL` to **BOTH** services (main bot AND cron):

#### **For Main Bot Service:**
1. Click on your **main bot service**
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Start typing `DATABASE_URL` and select: **`${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`** from autocomplete
5. Click **"Add"**

#### **For Cron Service:**
1. Click on your **cron service**
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Start typing `DATABASE_URL` and select: **`${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`** from autocomplete
5. Click **"Add"**

✅ Now both services can access the same PostgreSQL database!

---

### **Step 3: Deploy Updated Code**

1. Replace all files in your repository with the updated ones from this folder
2. **Important files changed:**
   - `verification.py` - Now uses database when `DATABASE_URL` is available
   - `database_simple.py` - NEW file for database operations
   - `requirements.txt` - Added `psycopg2-binary`
   - `main.py` - No changes, imports from verification.py
   - `verify_cron.py` - No changes, imports from verification.py

3. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add PostgreSQL support for Railway volume sharing"
   git push
   ```

4. Railway will automatically deploy both services

---

### **Step 4: Migrate Existing Data (One-Time)**

If you have existing groups and users configured, you need to migrate the data:

1. **SSH into your main bot service:**
   ```bash
   railway run python3 database_simple.py
   ```

   OR directly from Railway dashboard:
   - Click on main bot service
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Click "View Logs"
   - Run: `python3 database_simple.py`

2. You should see:
   ```
   🔄 Starting migration from files to database...
   📁 Migrating config.json...
   ✅ config.json migrated successfully
   📁 Migrating user_data.json...
   ✅ user_data.json migrated successfully
   ...
   ✅ Migration completed!
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Set Cron Schedule**

1. Click on your **cron service**
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Find **"Cron Schedule"** section
4. Enter: **`0 */6 * * *`** (runs every 6 hours)
5. Click **"Save"**

---

### **Step 6: Test Everything**

1. **Check main bot is running:**
   - Send `/help` to your bot in Telegram
   - Should respond normally

2. **Check cron can see data:**
   - Wait for next cron execution (or trigger manually)
   - Check cron logs - should show:
     ```
     🚀 Starting Railway cron verification job
     🔄 Starting periodic verification cycle for X groups
     ```

3. **Verify data sharing:**
   - Add a new group via `/setup` in main bot
   - Next cron run should verify that group

---

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
- Both services show `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
- Main bot can save groups/users
- Cron job can read groups/users
- No "No groups configured" error
- Cron runs every 6 hours and verifies users

### ❌ **If You See Errors:**

**"No groups configured for verification"**
- ✅ Check `DATABASE_URL` is set on cron service
- ✅ Run migration script to move data to database
- ✅ Verify PostgreSQL service is running

**"psycopg2 not found"**
- ✅ Make sure `psycopg2-binary` is in requirements.txt
- ✅ Redeploy both services

**"Connection refused"**
- ✅ Check PostgreSQL service is running
- ✅ Verify `DATABASE_URL` reference is correct: `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`

---

## 💰 **Cost Optimization**

### **Why This is Cheaper:**
- ✅ **Cron runs only when needed** (2-3 minutes every 6 hours)
- ✅ **No persistent worker** for background tasks
- ✅ **Railway charges per second** of execution
- ✅ **~50% cost savings** vs continuous worker

### **Estimated Monthly Costs:**
- PostgreSQL: ~$5/month
- Main Bot (persistent): ~$10-15/month
- Cron (scheduled): ~$1-2/month
- **Total: ~$15-20/month**

---

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan (If Needed)**

If something goes wrong, you can rollback:

1. Remove `DATABASE_URL` from both services
2. Bot will automatically fallback to JSON files
3. Works exactly like before

The code is designed to work with **OR** without database!

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Railway service logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Run migration script again if data is missing
4. Contact me with error logs
